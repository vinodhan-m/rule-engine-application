## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

            "userData": { "age": 35, "department": "IT" } 
            }
    Get All Rules:
      -GET /api/rules/all
Example Request

              {
                "evaluation": true
              }

### Front-end

The front-end of the application is built using React. It provides a user-friendly interface to create rules and evaluate them against user data.

Running the Front-end
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
2. Start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
3. Open http://localhost:3000 to view the application in your browser.

### Running the Application

To run the backend server:
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
2. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
Make sure the backend server is running before you start the front-end application.
